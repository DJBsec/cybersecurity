## Prompt 1

Can you give me 6 cybersecurity stories that have happened in the last 24 hours. I will need a summary for each of these stories as I will be using them to create an audio podcast. These stories should offer a mix of technical, practical, and policy-focused topics that can spark insightful discussion.

## Prompt 2 to get into MD

I need the output formated in markdown language, with the story title then the summary followed by a link to the reference for each.
